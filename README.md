Empire Partner Foundation Website:
This project is a re-creation of the Empire Partner Foundation website as part of my interview for a web developer role. The focus of the project is to design and develop three pages of the site using Tailwind CSS for styling, with additional enhancements like icons and animations.

Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to redesign and enhance the Empire Partner Foundation website with a modern and user-friendly layout. I focused on three key pages:

Home Page
About Us Page
Contact Page

Each page features responsive design, dynamic navigation, and smooth user interaction using animations.

Technologies Used:
This project uses the following technologies and tools:

HTML5: The structure and markup of the website.
Tailwind CSS: For efficient and responsive styling.
JavaScript (ES5+): Added form validation and interaction.
Heroicons: For beautiful SVG icons.
Live Server: For local development and previewing changes in real time.

Features:
1. Navigation Bar
A responsive navigation bar that adapts to various screen sizes.
Social media icons between the logo and the navigation links.
Mobile menu for small and tablet devices.
2. Contact Information Section
Responsive contact cards that display key contact information like address, email, and phone.
SVG icons added to each contact method for better visual presentation.
3. Smooth Scrolling
Implemented smooth scrolling across the site for enhanced navigation and user experience.
4. Contact Form
A simple contact form with basic client-side validation using JavaScript. It validates the user's name, email, and message fields before submission, showing error messages if the fields are invalid.
5. Animations
Smooth animations applied to certain sections and icons, making the site interactive and engaging.
